#put ideas and papers here:

Automated algorithmic trading: machine learning and agent-based modelling in complex adaptive financial markets
https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/397453/
(Holy fuck this is 100 pages...)

This paper uses regression trees and random forests to forecast markets.

Online adaptive machine learning based algorithm for implied volatility surface modeling
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950705118304350

This paper is pretty interesting. I think we can try this one. I put a pdf of the paper in hw/final_project. 

--------Updated by Matthew--------

Three types of projects we can choose:
(1) Application of existing algorithm to a new problem and potentially new data.
(2) Algorithmic work. Extend an existing algorithm or conceive a new one to solve some problem. This inherently includes the first option because you will need to test this new algorithm on data.
(3) Theoretical work. Create a new convergence bound on a learning algorithm. Show that at some limit one learning algorithm becomes another. Etc.

I think the paper that you put in hw/final_project would be a possible option to expand.
